This bot's help command will give a list of all functionalities included within the bot.

3 lines are to be modified in the main code:-
1. Create a new bot and add the invite link of that bot to code (check the invite command)
2. Add your discord id to the bot code to show you are the owner or remove this part if unwanted (check the help command)
3. Copy the bot token to the "bot.run" command (check last line of code)

#NOTE
Code won't run if the 3rd point is not fulfilled. Please look through a guide on how to create a bot using the "Discord Developer Portal".
